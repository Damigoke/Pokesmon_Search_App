# Pokemon Search App - Technical Test
Brief

Build a minimal Pokémon-themed Next.js application (TypeScript, App Router) within 60 minutes. Your solution should focus on clean, maintainable code and modern best practices.



Requirements

Search Page:

Create a page for searching Pokémon using a public API (e.g., PokéAPI), routed through your own /api endpoint.



Functional Transformations

Manipulate the API response using functional array methods (map, filter, reduce). Data should be displayed in a transformed, user-friendly way (not a raw passthrough).



Higher-Order Functions (HOFs):

Use at least two higher-order functions meaningfully:


API Request Wrapper: e.g., withRetry, withBaseUrl.

Route Middleware Wrapper: e.g., withCache, withTiming, or a composed wrapper.

UI Library and State Management:

Use a modern UI library (like Mantine, Chakra UI, or Material UI) for layout and styling (no vanilla HTML/CSS).

Implement a store/state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or Context API) for handling search results and/or cached data.

Code Quality & Engineering Principles:

Write reusable components and abstractions.

Follow the SOLID and DRY principles.

Prioritize maintainability and scalability in your architecture.

Bonus (Optional):

Make it fun: Display additions like Pokémon artwork, stats, or an interactive card for each result.

Add unit tests for a core HOF or data transformation.

Submission

Share a GitHub repo link (public).

Include a brief README explaining your solution and design choices.

What I’m looking for:

Reusable code structures

Proper use of HOFs and middlewares

Smart functional data transformations

UI best practices and clean layout

Demonstrated state management

Clear adherence to SOLID/DRY.
